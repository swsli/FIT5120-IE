= Why get a SSL padlock? =
* Trust - Starting from July 2018, Google Chrome has begun to mark all non SSL-websites as ‘Not Secure’. When your users see the broken padlock, their trust wavers!
* Security - SSL provides authentication, trust and compliance. If your customer is filling out forms, or making payments on your website, you need SSL to protect sensitive data from eavesdroppers.
* SEO - Google ranks SSL-enabled websites higher than unsecured websites. Hence, securing your website also helps get you on top of Google’s search results.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is a SSL Certificate? =
An SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificate is a digital certificate that authenticates the identity of a website and encrypts information sent to the server using SSL technology.

= Are your SSL certificates really free? =
Yes. All SSL certificates are generated by Let’s Encrypt® (nonprofit) with a mission to create a more secure and privacy-respecting Web by promoting the widespread adoption of HTTPS.

= What benefits does SSL provide? =
An SSL Cert protects your customers’ sensitive information such as their name, address, password, or credit card number by encrypting the data during transmission from their computer to your web server.

= How do I install my SSL certificate? =
You will be emailed a certificate and a private key. Simply go to your cPanel dashboard, click on SSL/TLS and follow the process to install SSL certificate.

= How long are the certificates valid? =
Let's Encrypt® certificates are valid for 90 days and can be renewed with no additional cost. You can easily renew them through our plugin.

= How do I renew an SSL certificate? =
Simply follow the same process you used to generate and install SSL certificate the first time and your certificates will be renewed.

= Do I need technical knowledge to set up an SSL? =
Our free version of the plugin does require you to upload files on your website to verify domain ownership.

= Is your plugin safe to install on my website? =
Our plugin is open-source and anyone can download and inspect it before installing on their website.

= Do you support Wildcard SSL? =
We currently do not support wildcard SSL. Our plugin is only built to generate SSL certificate for your WordPress website/blog.

= Which browsers will trust my certificate? =
All major browsers are supported.

= What is the verification process? =
The verification is a simple process to prove that you own the domain for which you are requesting the certificate.

= Do I need to do the verification again when I renew? =
The verification results are valid, at the time of writing, for 30 days. If you renew within that period, you should not need to re-verify. Outside of that period you will need to do the verification again. However, it is a very simple process that requires almost no time.

= I have installed the certificate correctly, but my site is not shown as "Secure" =
The most likely reason for this is that you are still loading some resources, such as images for example, via HTTP. Browsers in this case will show "Mixed content" errors in the developers console. If you do not want to use developer tools, you can easily check which resources those might be by using ["Why No Padlock?"](https://whynopadlock.com) service. You can read more about "Mixed Content" and how to prevent it [here](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/prevent-mixed-content/fixing-mixed-content).

= Can I see the name of my company on the certificate? =
Free certificates are of Domain Validation type (DV) and do not hold that information. To have the information about your company, the certificate would need to pass Organization Validation (OV) or Extended Validation (EV). Both require paperwork (such as actual company checks) and cannot be offered for free as a result.
